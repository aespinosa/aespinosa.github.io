I am a DevOps professional that works on various distributed systems to support
web-scale, big data and high performance systems.  I am the author of <a

High Performance</a>.  It shows most of the components needed for having a
successful Docker-based deployment of your application in production.

If you have interesting problems that need to scale out and automate
infrastructure, shoot me an email.

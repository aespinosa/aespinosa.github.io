I am currently a DevOps professional in Tokyo.  My other interests revolve
around cloud computing, distributed systems, and big data.

<p>
Before moving to Tokyo, I was a Ph.D. student in Computer Science under the
supervision of Ian Foster.  I worked on scaling data-intesive scientific
applications to supercomputers and other large computing infrastructures.

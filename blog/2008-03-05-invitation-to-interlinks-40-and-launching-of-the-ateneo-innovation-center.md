Hello from the [Ateneo Innovation Center](http://innovation.ateneo.edu),

On March 14, we are holding [Interlinks 4.0](http://ohm.ecce.admu.edu.ph/innovation/bin/view/Interlinks/WebHome), where the Ateneo Science and Engineering students will present their recent Research results. Undergrad students and MS Students in fields of Mathematics, Biology, Chemistry, Environmental Science, Electrical Engineering and Bioengineering, Physics, and Health Science will present poster papers on their research. They will explain the many applications of their work to forming new high technology companies in the Philippines.

We are also launching the Ateneo Innovation Center, where we will be doing multi-disciplinary research in fields of interest to industry like new energy approaches - energy from algae, wireless logistics for supply chain management, wireless sensor systems for disaster monitoring., digital medical databases for patient monitoring, environmental cleanup using seaweed, new herbal medicines, and embedded software for gaming. Interlinks is the Ateneo's focused effort to link Faculty driven research with industry's need for leading edge technology and highly trained professionals.

We have invited Jim Paredes, Mon Isberto, Harvey Keh, and Paco Sandejas to speak in the [why Not Forum](http://whynotforum.com/) style. They will give us short provocative talks on "How R&D and Technology is Critical to Success in their Fields".

Of course the stars of Interlinks 4.0 are the Ateneo students and their contributions to Faculty driven Research. Many of these theses are highly innovative, so we are inviting many high technology companies and investment organizations to attend.

Please help us spread the word, by using your resources to advertise Interlinks 4.0.

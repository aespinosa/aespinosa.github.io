Classes have been suspended for three consecutive days due to heavy rain.  At last I can slack off preparing for class and concentrate on the other side of academic work: research.

The ECCE Department is very interested in studying its properties in the context of Philippine tropical rain.  We have various publications exhibiting the crazy stuff we do these days.  One of our projects it to characterize rain in terms of its effects on wireless telecommunications systems.  A few weeks ago, we went out to the field to make key field measurements of its received signal levels over some distances.  It makes sense that the distance between two directional transceivers increases, it is harder to align them.

Here are some pictures during the propagation studies.  The operation was performed ona clear sunny day.

title: Book Release: Docker High Performance
---

My book project with Packt Publishing has been released last January. The book is composed 
of various tricks on using Docker I've collected under my sleeve. In addition,
I have also written how I think Docker relates to classic thoughts in Web Operations 
like continuous delivery, capacity planning, etc.

The following are some links where it is available both in print and online:

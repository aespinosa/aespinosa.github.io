title: Book Release: Docker High Performance
---

My book project with Packt Publishing has been released last January. The book
is composed of various tricks on using Docker I've collected under my sleeve.
In addition, I have also written how I think Docker relates to classic thoughts
in Web Operations like continuous delivery, capacity planning, etc.

The following are some links where it is available both in print and online:

* [Packt Publishing](http://bit.ly/1RkphwU)

For questions and comments regarding the Code samples in the book, you can file
them as GitHub Issues in

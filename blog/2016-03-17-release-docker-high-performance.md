title: Book Release: Docker High Performance
---

My book project with Packt Publishing has been released last January. The book
is composed of various tricks on using Docker I've collected under my sleeve.
In addition, I have also written how I think Docker relates to classic thoughts
in Web Operations like continuous delivery, capacity planning, etc.

The following are some links where it is available both in print and online:

* [Amazon](http://amzn.com/1785886800)
* [Packt Publishing](https://www.packtpub.com/networking-and-servers/docker-high-performance)

For questions and comments regarding the Code samples in the book, you can file
them as GitHub Issues in
[dockerhp/code-samples/issues](https://github.com/dockerhp/code-samples/issues).

Here is the complete bibliographical information when citing the book in IEEE
format:

  <h1>Upgrading to Gutsy Gibbon</h1>
  <p>2007 November  7</p>

  <section>
    <p>A few weeks ago, I decided to upgrade my desktops from Ubuntu 7.04 Feisty Fawn to 7.10 Gutsy Gibbon. Using the upgrade instructions from the <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/upgrading">Ubuntu website</a>, I used the network upgrade method for Ubuntu servers. I did not want to use the update-manager application to manage the upgrade because of a bad upgrade experience from Dapper Drake. To resolve my previous problem, I performed a complete reinstall of my system.</p>
<p>Most blogs and reviews of Gutsy highlights enhanced 3D Desktop support using compiz. For my non-Linux friends, below are some screenshots of my desktop:</p>

<p>The figure above shows the Shift Switcher plugin. It cycles through all of the window applications through a nice panel shuffler interface. Below is the “Mac-like” Scale Window plugin. It gives an overview of all the windows present on my Desktop.</p>

<p>Another key upgrade of Gutsy was the shift from using the teTeX disribution to TeXlive. These are the package distribution for the LaTeX/ TeX typesetting suite. As an academic, this is one of the most important applications in my workstation’s setup. Here is an excerpt from the tetex-bin transition package:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>teTeX is no longer developed upstream, and has been replaced by the TeX Live collection. This is a transitional package to bring former teTeX users a decent selection of TeX Live packages. It can be safely removed (unless some external packages still depend on tetex-bin).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note, however, that the functionality of the TeX Live subset that is chosen is not exactly the same as that of tetex-bin, due to the different splitting schemes.</p>
<p>When I upgraded my home desktop, the LaTeX upgrade took most of the upgrade time because it keeps caching the fonts for every package. Thus, I first remove the tetex-* packages from my office workstation before performing another upgrade. When the upgrade to Gutsy was finished, I installed the related texlive-* packages.</p>

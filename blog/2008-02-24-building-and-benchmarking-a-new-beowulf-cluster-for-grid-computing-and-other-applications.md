I presented last Feb 23 a paper documenting the commissioning of our new Beowulf cluster.  The [8th Philippine Computing Congress](http://www.csp.org.ph) was held in University of the Philippines--Diliman.  My presentation was held at the new Computer Science building (beside the EEE building).
Here is a short description of the paper:

Title: Building and Benchmarking a New Beowulf Cluster for Grid Computing and Other Applications
Authors: Allan Espinosa and Rafael Saldana

**Abstract**


> 
In this paper, we report our upgrade of our AGILA Beowulf cluster.  Commodity desktop computers were used for the compute nodes.  The server node was set-up as a high-end server class machine to house terabytes of data from the universityâ€™s scientific computing applications such as cellular automata, molecular dynamics, mesoscale climate modeling, and computational models requiring high performance computing infrastructures.




Embedded below is my presentation.  Enjoy!

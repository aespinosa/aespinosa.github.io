<p>I was in the department this morning when something caught my attention: one of the workstations display the Google webpage. Their <a href="http://www.google.com.ph/logos/lego08.gif">logo</a> was made up of LEGO bricks! Later on, <a href="http://slashdot.org/articles/08/01/28/1312215.shtml">Slashdot</a> posted the article about the 50th Anniversary of the LEGO brick. So that was the occassion. LEGO made a significant contribution in my life. Aside from having the toy bricks during childhood, my research career came from a LEGO related project:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://scinet.dost.gov.ph/union/ShowSearchResult.php?page=&amp;sid=2&amp;rec=result&amp;id=Allan+M.+Espinosa">Robotag: The Implementation of a Robotic Kit that Combines Primitive Behavior to Promote Higher Levels of Competence</a> - this was the title of my senior research project in Philippine Science High School. It brought me to places like the Intel Philippine Science Fair. I enjoyed meeting from around the Philippines and some of which I met during college.</li>
<li>My project gave me enough experience to be a facilitator for PSHS-SEI (Science Education Institute) robotics workshop. It was a summer workshop for science teachers around the Philippine to prepare them for teaching a robotics elective in their respective high schools. The government gave away LEGO Mindstorms kits to each school. This was also my first paycheck as a “professional”!</li>
<li>I was invited to give a talk on mechanical design of robots using LEGO bricks. It was an introductory workshop for high school teachers to prepare for the Philippine Robot Olympiad. The event was sponsored by <a href="http://www.felta.ph/">Felta, Inc</a>. the distributor of LEGO Dacta, the educational kit version of the Mindstorms system. The PSHS-SEI robotics program on the other hand used the commercial editions of the set distributed by Giftgate.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is my presentation on mechanical design a few years back. I discussed different types of joints and elaborated on the weakness and stress of the different types. It was basically a vector mechanics lecture using LEGO bricks for visualization. Additional slides are included elaborating on documenting your creations using LEGO cad software like <a href="http://www.lm-software.com/mlcad/">MLCad</a> and <a href="http://ldraw.org">ldraw</a>.</p>

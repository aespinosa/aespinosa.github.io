**Abstract**

> Using RFID technologies, this paper reports a proof-of-concept design  
and deployment for tracking expensive medical supplies for  
tuberculosis patients.  The supply chain starts from the distribution  
centers down to regional health units.  The supply chain tracking  
system features the novel use of an integrated subversion based  
staging server to provide data synchronization between the various  
distribution centers and a remote backend database.

Yey! Malapit na malapit lang :) More information about the program and registration information is found in its [OSG Page](https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Education/MWGS08). Workshop dates from Sept 17-19.


> [The Open Science Grid](http://www.opensciencegrid.org/) (OSG), the [TeraGrid](http://www.teragrid.org/) and the [Computation Institute](http://www.ci.uchicago.edu/) of [The University of Chicago](http://www.uchicago.edu/) present a three day intensive course in grid computing and its application to scientific discovery.

The course introduces the techniques of grid and distributed        computing for science and engineering fields, with hands-on training in the      use of national grid computing resources. The workshop introduces essential      skills that will be needed by researchers in the natural and applied             sciences, engineering, and computer science to conduct and support               large-scale computation and data analysis in emerging grid and distributed       computing environments.

School participants will work with grid computing experts during the 3-day training. The workshop will focus on enabling the use of the national cyberinfrastructure -[The Open Science Grid](http://www.opensciencegrid.org/) and [TeraGrid](http://www.teragrid.org/)- to perform               large-scale computations  and  data-intensive processing  in the your field of research. Participants will learn to use grids of thousands of processors and will be able to continue to use these resources for their research after the class. We encourage you to bring your research project to us for suggestions and help in porting your application to the grid. We would like to offer you support in transitioning your application to this platform.

I was in the department this morning when something caught my attention: one of the workstations display the Google webpage. Their [logo](http://www.google.com.ph/logos/lego08.gif) was made up of LEGO bricks! Later on, [Slashdot](http://slashdot.org/articles/08/01/28/1312215.shtml) posted the article about the 50th Anniversary of the LEGO brick. So that was the occassion. LEGO made a significant contribution in my life. Aside from having the toy bricks during childhood, my research career came from a LEGO related project:


  * [Robotag: The Implementation of a Robotic Kit that Combines Primitive Behavior to Promote Higher Levels of Competence](http://scinet.dost.gov.ph/union/ShowSearchResult.php?page=&sid=2&rec=result&id=Allan+M.+Espinosa) - this was the title of my senior research project in Philippine Science High School. It brought me to places like the Intel Philippine Science Fair. I enjoyed meeting from around the Philippines and some of which I met during college.
  * My project gave me enough experience to be a facilitator for PSHS-SEI (Science Education Institute) robotics workshop. It was a summer workshop for science teachers around the Philippine to prepare them for teaching a robotics elective in their respective high schools. The government gave away LEGO Mindstorms kits to each school. This was also my first paycheck as a "professional"!
  * I was invited to give a talk on mechanical design of robots using LEGO bricks. It was an introductory workshop for high school teachers to prepare for the Philippine Robot Olympiad. The event was sponsored by [Felta, Inc](http://www.felta.ph/). the distributor of LEGO Dacta, the educational kit version of the Mindstorms system. The PSHS-SEI robotics program on the other hand used the commercial editions of the set distributed by Giftgate.


Here is my presentation on mechanical design a few years back.  I discussed different types of joints and elaborated on the weakness and stress of the different types.  It was basically a vector mechanics lecture using LEGO bricks for visualization.  Additional slides are included elaborating on documenting your creations using LEGO cad software like [MLCad](http://www.lm-software.com/mlcad/) and [ldraw](http://ldraw.org).

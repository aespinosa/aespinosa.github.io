Authors whose name are italicized are the ones who will conduct the presentation.

ICT4Health resulted from Ateneo's collaboration with several partners from the [ONCO-MEDIA project](http://www.onco-media.com). Its main focus is to use grid computing technologies to support information retrieval operations on medical images using context. We hope that this event will facilitate generation of new partners from several institutions in the Philippines, Singapore, Japan, Asia and France.

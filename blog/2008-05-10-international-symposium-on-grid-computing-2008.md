Last April 7-11, I went to the [International Symposium on Grid Computing](http://event.twgrid.org/isgc2008) together with [Dr. Raffy Saldana](http://raffysaldana.blogspot.com).  We presented our current work on health and environmental applications of grid computing for the EUAsiaGrid kick-off meeting. Aside from this, we made preparations to prepare our site in Ateneo to be part of the [EGEE production grid](http://public.eu-egee.org/). This involved getting certificates from the Asia Pacific Regional Operations Centre. We made certificate request to the [Academia Sinica Grid Computing Center](http://www.twgrid.org/) to make our site a trusted part of the grid.

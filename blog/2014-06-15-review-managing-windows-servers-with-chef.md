title: Review: Managing Windows Services With Chef
---

Here's a few brush notes review of the book *[Managing Windows Services With
Chef](http://www.packtpub.com/managing-windows-servers-with-chef/book)*.

I like the chapters dealing with specific cloud providers. The book gives detail
on what is needed to setup up the chef-client properly on the cloud providers
like firewall configuration, winrm settings, etc. It is handy and will
definitely save a few hours of yak shaving when working wit windows.

The windows specific stuff are a handy reference like DISM for people coming
from a mostly Linux background.  An overview of windows resources from the
opscode documentation in the book is a handy reference.  


The advanced section on testing introduces rspec from people coming from a .net
development background which is handy.

However, the book is a bit dated for the May release.  Chef omnibus installers
have been available for quite some while.  It is mentioned in the latter
chapters but the first chapter still describes the non-omnibus way of
bootstraping chef.   

In general the book could have used a bit more proofreading to update some aging
parts of the documentation.  But nonetheless its a handy reference to get some
windows specific documentation if you're into dead trees.  for online
documetnation the opscode webpage is handier.

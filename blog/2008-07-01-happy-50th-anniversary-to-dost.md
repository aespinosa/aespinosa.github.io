Every second week of July (7-11) we celebrate the [National Science and Technology Week.](http://nstw.dost.gov.ph) This year, it is [DOST](http://www.dost.gov.ph)'s 50th anniversary so it is expected to be a very grand celebration (also probably the reason for cost-cutting the previous years :D).  Too bad I won't be able to go this year :(

I looked at the DOST website to grabe some teaser news but the website does not seem to work.  When I click on a news article, it goes back to the main page.  Hey DOST web people, updates please! :)

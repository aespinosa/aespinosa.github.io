The [department website](http://ohm.ecce.admu.edu.ph) is now revamped.  Aside from using the [TWiki](http://twiki.org) system to manage its content, the BlogPlugin application is installed to facilitate posts.  This will help a lot in exposing the department to the public.  Featured posts are from [Dr. Greg Tangonan](https://ohm.ecce.admu.edu.ph/wiki/bin/view/Main/GregTangonan) and his Innovation and Technology class.

Make sure to save your bookmarks to https://ohm.ecce.admu.edu.ph .  we also have an [RSS feed link](https://ohm.ecce.admu.edu.ph/wiki/bin/view/Blog/WebRss) for easy content syndication into your news readers.

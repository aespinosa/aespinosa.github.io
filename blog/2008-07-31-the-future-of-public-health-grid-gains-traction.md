> **Feature - The future of public health: The grid gains traction**

Dr. Ida A. Bengston (1881-1952) was one of the first women employed on the scientific staff of the Hygienic Laboratory of the Public Health Service, the predecessor to the National Institutes of Health. Bengston was particularly noted for her studies of bacterial toxins.


What are the infrastructure challenges of public health informatics that requires leveraging the grid?Â  Of course Doc Eloy Marcelo has his [CHITS](http://chits.ph/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page) and also there is the [OpenMRS](http://openmrs.org/wiki/OpenMRS) project.Â  Perhaps this is an *integration* of existing systems? It would be interesting to see a web service interfacing CHITS and OpenMRS.

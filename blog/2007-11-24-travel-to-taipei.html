  <h1>Travel to Taipei</h1>
  <p>2007 November 24</p>

  <section>
    <p>Last November 18-24, I went to three research meetings and conferences in Taipei. My travel expenses were shouldered by the ONCO-MEDIA project while my hotel accommodation was sponsored by the ICT Asia seminar program. Both funding sources came from the French government. I just love being an academic!</p>
<p>I traveled via Cebu Pacific to the Taoyuan International Airport. Delegates were fetched by the organizers from ICT Asia. When we were going out the compound of the airport, I saw a very interesting name for a courier service in Taipei: Pinoy Express.</p>

<p>It took almost an hour to reach the city. Our hotel, Academia Sinica Activity Center was located in the outskirts of Taipei. This made the trip even farther. The institute is a very big compound. It consists of various research centers from environmental science to high performance computing. Below is a view from inside my room:</p>

<p>I will post later in detail what transpired during the conference like Ateneoâ€™s presentations, the very impressive networking activities. Pictures will also be posted showing sights and sounds of Taipei.</p>

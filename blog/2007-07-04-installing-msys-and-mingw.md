cThese are installation instructions for my CE 21: Introduction to Computing class so that students will be able to install the compilers on their systems at home.
Download the following files from the [MinGW website](http://www.mingw.org):



	
  * MSYS-1.0.10.exe

	
  * binutils-2.16.91-20060119-1.tar.gz

	
  * gcc-core-3.4.2-20040916-1.tar.gz

	
  * gcc-g++-3.4.2-20040916-1.tar.gz

	
  * mingw-runtime-3.12.tar.gz

	
  * w32api-3.9.tar.gz

Assuming that the students downloaded them on their desktop as described in the screenshot above, the video below shows the details of installing MSYS.  Take note the the installation directory is _c:\msys_ and not c:\msys\1.0.

The next step is to extract the 5 tarballs (via _tar -xvzf_) in the /mingw directory.  Open the MSYS terminal and use the next video as a guide.

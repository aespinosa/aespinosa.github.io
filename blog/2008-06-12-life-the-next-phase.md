The past few weeks was very tight as I preparing from my resignation as an instructor in Ateneo (and attending parties). I will be joining the Computer Science Department at the University of Chicago for my graduate studies. My work will be on grid computing and distributed computing under the supervision of [Dr. Ian Foster](http://www-fp.mcs.anl.gov/%7Efoster/), the _father_ of grid computing himself! He is also one of the founders of the [Globus Toolkit projec](http://www.globus.org)t, the key middleware in every grid deployment in the world.

This blog site will still be up and maintained but my faculty page and ECCE wiki page will not be updated as much for the next six years. Below is my new contact information:  




  * Graduate web page: [http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~aespinosa](http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/%7Eaespinosa)
  * Email: aespinosa[at]uchicago[dot]edu, aespinosa[at]cs[dot]uchicago[dot]edu  



So if you're around the Chicago-Hyde park area, drop me an email and let's meet up! :P

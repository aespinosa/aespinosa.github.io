I have decided to separate my personal (actually it's more technical and highly niched) blog to my academic pages.  The following are the other pages that I maintain:  
  


  * [Course pages](http://ohm.ecce.admu.edu.ph/%7Eaespinosa)-separating the course page into a more structured manner and editing with low level access allows me more flexibility in terms of organizing content per course. As a non-mouse person (some one who does not like moving the cursor very much), I find coding a few lines of html easier than going all through the menus of Wordpress' page manager. A snippet of my research interests and publications are also included in the page for people to see what I have been working on for the past few years.  

  * [Research page](http://ohm.ecce.admu.edu.ph/wiki/bin/view/Main/AllanEspinosa)-As of now, this page basically contains my faculty profile with respect to the [ECCE deparment site](http://ohm.ecce.admu.edu.ph). I decided to post most of the updates of my research work such as publications, slide presentations here so that the department can easily reorganize content of the entire site. Plus a wiki structure provides facilities for internal groupware collaboration. Thus we can easily fork internal proposals into full-length presentations for public consumption.  

  
  
Another feature in my research and course pages is the integration of online document and presentation viewers.  No need to download the entire presentation for a preview!  Most of the presentations in the pages above either came from [Google Docs](http://docs.google.com) or [Zoho Office](http://www.zoho.com). I used the [prototype](http://prototypejs.org) AJAX libraries to asynchronously load the presentation on my pages. I hope to give a more pleasurable user experience for people visiting my course and research pages.
